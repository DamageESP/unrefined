# ROADMAP

## Features of the MVP

- Create a refinement session with at least a ticket to estimate
- Share the link to the estimation page
- Estimate a ticket, providing story points or skipping the estimation
  - Write the breakdown of the provided story points
- Show the result of the estimation
  - Provide a way to re-estimate a ticket
- Estimate a new ticket directly from the result or watch pages

## Ideas for future improvements

- Friendly development environment especially to modify frontend code, ideas:
  - Dockerfile that runs the server
  - Alias in deps.edn to run the server
- Change the estimation page to force the use of the breakdown form
  - The total will be calculated summing the breakdowns
  - It would be nice to be able to configure the breakdown items
  - It would be nice to be able to enable breakdowns or the single estimation
- Better design and UX
- Persistent storage
